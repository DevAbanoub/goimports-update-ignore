goimports-update-ignore
=======================

Scan `$GOPATH/src/` and generate a `$GOPATH/src/.goimportsignore` to make
[goimports](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports) run faster
and use less CPU.

`.goimportsignore` [was introduced](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16386)
to goimports on the 15th July 2016.

# Why?

Less CPU eaten by goimports, longer battery life. Faster time to run.

In particular, I don't use my `$GOPATH` just for go code and I have some very
deep source trees, such as the linux kernel repository lying around.

# Features

* Avoid generating overly specific rules by limiting the depth (configurable).
* Measure the number of directories scanned by goimports by invoking it and
  length of time and CPU time taken in the worst case.

# Warnings

**Data loss risk**: Invoking this will overwrite any existing
                   `$GOPATH/src/.goimportsignore` you have, without asking.

Magically ignoring things is the sort of thing you can easily forget about.
Later you'll be wondering why something mysteriously doesn't work, and it will
be because it was ignored in some distant past.

Use at your own risk.

# Example usage

Here's what `goimports-update-ignore` does on @pwaller's `$GOPATH`, with warm
disk caches.

```
$ go get github.com/pwaller/goimports-update-ignore

$ # Start with nothing
$ rm $GOPATH/src/.goimportsignore

$ # Measure original times.
$ goimports-update-ignore -measure-only
